# Projects

Here are three real projects I built recently.

## 1) NASA APOD Search App
- **Tech:** React, Vite
- **Features:** Search APOD by date, save favorites to localStorage, responsive UI.
- **Purpose:** A small experiment in APIs, UX, and local persistence.

## 2) Balaji Nursing Caretaker Services (Content + Site)
- **Work:** SEO content, service pages (Dementia Care), basic site scaffolding in PHP.
- **Outcome:** Improved local search visibility and clearer service descriptions.

## 3) Contact Book (React + Firebase)
- **Features:** Add/Edit/Delete contacts, search, and routing with React Router.
- **Notes:** Implemented for a class assignment — includes authentication mock.
