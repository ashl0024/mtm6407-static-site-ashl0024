Hi, I’m Ashlay, a designer who enjoys creating simple, clear, and meaningful
digital experiences. I work across UX/UI, web design, and front-end
development, focusing on layouts, visuals, and user-friendly design.
I love solving problems through design, organising ideas into clean interfaces,
and paying attention to the details that make a product feel easy and enjoyable
to use. I’m calm under pressure, thoughtful with my choices, and adaptable in
different team environments.
